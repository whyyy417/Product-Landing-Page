<h1>Product Landing Page</h1>

<p>For my Fourth project on Freecodecamp, I had the task of making a Product Landing Page. For this project, I challenged myself to make a fully responsive website to the best of my abilities. Upon Finishing the project, I have now gotten a better understanding of how to make a fully responsive web page. Working on this little project has helped me improve my HTML and CSS coding.</p>
